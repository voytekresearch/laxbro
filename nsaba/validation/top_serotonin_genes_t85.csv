Desmocollins, along with desmogleins, are cadherin-like transmembrane glycoproteins that are major components of the desmosome. Desmosomes are cell-cell junctions that help resist shearing forces and are found in high concentrations in cells subject to mechanical stress. This gene is found in a cluster with other desmocollin family members on chromosome 18. Mutations in this gene are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-11, and reduced protein expression has been described in several types of cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2015]']"

The gene was identified through a positional cloning approach, targeted at the isolation of the gene responsible for Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) Muscular Dystrophies. DMD is a recessive, fatal, X-linked disorder occurring at a frequency of about 1 in 3,500 new-born males. BMD is a milder allelic form. In general, DMD patients carry mutations which cause premature translation termination (nonsense or frame shift mutations), while in BMD patients dystrophin is reduced either in molecular weight (derived from in-frame deletions) or in expression level. The dystrophin gene is highly complex, containing at least eight independent, tissue-specific promoters and two polyA-addition sites. Furthermore, dystrophin RNA is differentially spliced, producing a range of different transcripts, encoding a large set of protein isoforms. Dystrophin (as encoded by the Dp427 transcripts) is a large, rod-like cytoskeletal protein which is found at the inner surface of muscle fibers. Dystrophin is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which bridges the inner cytoskeleton (F-actin) and the extra-cellular matrix. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]']"
